Some of you may know that we have a friend in Finchley where we live, by the name of Roy Naisbitt, who worked in film, mainly as an animator (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, A Christmas Carol and Space Jam). He's now 87, full of the joys of life (so much so that he's an exec producer on this record and has even done a bit of roadie-ing) and we meet regularly for a scoop... you'll also see him at almost every London show we do. Roy's first job in the film world was working with the special effects team on Stanley Kubrick's Oscar winning '2001: A Space Odyssey'. This photograph was taken (in the 60's) by the director of special effects and Oscar winner, Doug Trumbull. We're delighted to be using this as our album cover and hope you dig it. It's been 50 years since this photo was taken. The M&M logo design was hand drawn by Mark Naisbitt, one of the great sons of Roy. ",

The crowd were in early, well up for it and the sound in that venue was perfect. The second show was in a venue called the Swan in Stockwell. We met with the band and played from 11pm - it was f*cking mental. I've never played to a crowd as up for a party (or as drunk) as they were in the Swan. The craic was 91.",

The next day we were record of the week and on rotate on a number of stations with an endless list of congratulatory messages of love for the song... I was shocked. It's never moved this fast and I feel like we've definitely made the right decision on the single choice (although I still think the best has yet to come). One journalist called it a 'proper solid indie guitar anthem, stuffed with uplifting harmonies, harking back to the glory days of Britpop, when shiny bright tunes of this ilk jangled away on almost every station across the land'.",

We enjoyed playing in Chelmsford and Hereford too but the most enjoyable one of December would have to be our Dublin date in a local pub in Rathcoole 'The Rathcoole Inn'. We rammed the house and raised almost €4000 for the Pieta House charity. It was so good to see our enormous contingent of family and friends, coming together to support a great cause.

It was a special moment \n April - Made massive progress in the studio. This was the month when the album started coming together perfectly. Went to Coachella festival in the US too. \n May - Created a buzz by playing some full band shows in the UK including a very well attended show in The Hospital Club in London. \n June - Made our European debut when we went to The Netherlands to play in Volendam, The Hague and Breda (as well as a pit stop in Amsterdam). Great times. \n July - Shot the video and released 'Stand Down' which was A-Listed on Radio 1 Ireland and received some airplay in the UK. \n August - Played sh*t loads of festivals and toured the UK. \n September - Went on our first full band tour of Ireland, finishing off in The Dublin Unitarian Church. It really was a special show (and month). \n October - Mastered our album at Abbey Road Studios and played in The Royal Albert Hall.

I really feel like this one is a giant leap in sound, songwriting and all round playing. We have had such a cracking bunch of musicians play on this album. When you have players who've worked with Bowie, Pink Floyd, Kasabian, Sinead O'Connor and George Michael (the list goes on) coming to play on songs you've written, it's pretty mind-blowing stuff.",
     text: "On the live side of things, we played a few great ones in October. We did an industry showcase and became members of the world famous Groucho Club in Soho. Since becoming members we've been having a great buzz in there (too often to be honest) and as our social lives grow from hanging around with rock stars and actors, I can't help but feel like the bank account balance (and liver) is shrinking.

It's always an amazing experience playing with Damo and he never fails to tear the house down when he (and his adoring crowd) sings. I'm sure that he'll go down as a 'Dublin legend', if he's not already achieved the status.",

     text: "Of everything that's happened this month (and this year for that matter) I would have to say that mastering our album at Abbey Road Studios is without a doubt the highlight for me. As you probably know, Greg and I are Beatles fanatics and to go to work in Abbey Road was just the most incredible feeling. We drank red wine and mastered our album, stopping often to wander around the studios and to listen to stories of The Beatles' time recording there, from our really cool mastering engineer, Alex. I was overcome by emotion when we walked down the steps and into studio 2. I could feel the history and I also felt like I'd been there before having watched so many Beatles documentaries. I played the piano that Lady Madonna was recorded on (it sounds just as it did). We then finished the mastering and listened back, all with huge smiles. ",

We then decided it’d be a great idea to swim/wash ourselves in the river (Feale I think) before heading to the Listowel races. We played Mike The Pies (love this place) that evening.",

A couple of years ago, I was asked to write a song for a charity which catered to drug rehabilitation clinics around the U.K. and Ireland... 'Love & Be Loved' is what I came up with. The message in this song is simple - 'you're not alone, sure I wrote you a song'. I genuinely believe that music is a healer and my main reason for writing is to reach out, if even only to one person in the hope of easing a troubled time or a heart ache. My favourite songs to write are ones with a message of positivity and love and we all feel that now is the right time to release this track.",
